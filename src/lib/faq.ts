// Help / FAQ content + a tiny parser for it.
//
// The FAQ lives as Markdown at legal/faq.md so it's easy to edit and the
// git history shows content changes as plain diffs — same approach as the
// Terms of Service (legal/tos-*.md). Each question is a `## ` heading; the
// answer is everything until the next `## ` heading. parseFaq turns that
// into structured pairs the page renders. To add a question, edit the
// markdown — no code change needed (the "framework for adding more" the
// product owner asked for in #78).

// Split the markdown into { question, answer } pairs. `## ` headings start a
// question; everything up to the next `## ` is its answer. Anything before the
// first `## ` (a title or intro) is ignored. Blank lines inside an answer are
// preserved as paragraph breaks.
